# Operators
## We are discussing about Arithmetic Operators.

In coding, **arithmetic operators** are symbols that represent mathematical operations between two operands. 

The five arithmetic operators in C are:
- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`

#### # Please ensure that you are in node environment. 
## 1. Addition `+`
It adds the second number with the first.
```node
> 6+2
```
and the output will be:
```node

8
```
## 2. Subtraction `-`
It subtracts the second number from the first.
```node
> 5-3
```
and the output will be:
```node
2
```
## 3. Multiplication `*`
It multiplies the second number with the first.
```node
> 1*0
```
and the output will be:
```node
0
```
## 4. Division `/`
It divides the first number by the second.
```node
> 5/3
```
and the output will be:
```node
1.6666666666666667
```
## 5. Modulus `%`
It gives the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.
```node
> 5%3
```
and the output will be:
```node
2
```

#### When evaluating a mathematical expression in coding (or generally in mathematics), follows the below order known as **<u>BODMAS</u>**:

**Brackets:** Solve expressions inside brackets first.

**Orders:** Next, calculate any exponents (powers) or roots.

**Division and Multiplication:** Then, perform division and multiplication from left to right.

**Addition and Subtraction:** Lastly, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
